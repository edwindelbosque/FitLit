# FitLit Project


## General Info

We were given a dataset from the Mod 2 instructors at Turing and had to take the data and display it in a meaningful way.
The repository can be found <a href="https://github.com/edwindelbosque/FitLit">here</a>. The project specs can be found <a href="https://frontend.turing.io/projects/fitlit.html">here</a>. The live page can be accessed <a href="https://edwindelbosque.github.io/FitLit/">here</a>.

- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
- Display information on the page while maintaining ability to test class properties and methods
- Create a data dashboard that is easy to use and displays information in a clear way
