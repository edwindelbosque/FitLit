# FitLit Project

## Summary
FitLit is an original activity tracker dashboard similar to Fitbit. For this project, we had access to a large activity tracker dataset from many users over many days. Similarly to how Fitbit devices log data and present it on a dashboard for their users. Our main purpose was to transform all the data into meaningful information for the user, and to display it with an original design for the user to view and see their latest activity stats, goals, and milestones.

## Goals and Objectives

- We've made a working application meeting the next goals
- Implement ES6 classes that communicate to each other as needed
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD (Test-Driven Development)
- Use of object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
- Display information on the page while maintaining ability to test class properties and methods
- Create a data dashboard that is easy to use and displays information in a clear way

## Built With

- **JavaScript ES6**
- **TDD:** Chai & Mocha
- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
